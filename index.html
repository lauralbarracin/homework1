			<p>Born and raised in London Ontario. I am 27 and still dont know what I want to do when I grow up. I have an advanced diploma in Environmental Lab technology and a cumulative educational career of over 7 years. I have taken Interactive Media Development after spending 2 years in Computer Programming because I am interested in the applications of UI and UX. </p>

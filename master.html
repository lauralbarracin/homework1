            Hello, my name is Kelly. I am what you call a girl gamer. I am 20 years old. And I wreck people in video games

            With Artwork, I enjoy doing Source Filmmaker the most, I've been getting into Blender and 4D cinama with the advancement of College. Trying out stuff with that and I enjoy drawing both digitally and traditionally although I'm more of a concept artist than a character, landscape artist. Just something you'd see in a business perspective.
            <br><br>

            I am also really into gaming. The games that have the most time in is SMITE, Overwatch, Apex Legends, Hunt Showdown, and Guilty Gear Strive. Just so much games I love, and they're mostly Cooperative or Multiplayer games as I get that human interaction. 
            <br><br>

            I am also really into manga and anime. The first anime I've seen is Death Note, and over time I've come to love Fantasy/Isekai anime and manga. I am a weeaboo and otaku; there is a huge difference. Otaku is mainly just the content that's pushed out of Japan. Which many people say they're Weebs but aren't close to it. The true definition of weeaboo's are an appreication and study of Japanese Culture and history. I for one, love Japanese folklore. The family of Tsukiyomi, Ama and Susuno, definitely a favourite. Going back to Danzaburou the mischievious little tuniki. And the King Kappa of Kuzenbo. Otaku's are just anime and manga enjoyers. Anyone can be that. 
            <br><br>

            I am proud of my ethnicity, that being Native American. I am OjiCree (Ojibway+Cree), part of the turtle clan and my name is Gumbawa Mashiit Migisi, which means Soaring Around Eagle, my colours are Orange, Purple and Yellow.
